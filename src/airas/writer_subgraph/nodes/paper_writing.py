Your goal is to write a clear, structured, and academically rigorous research paper in plain English.
Avoid LaTeX commands or special formatting; focus solely on academic content quality.

The paper should contain the following sections and some tips are provided below:
{% for section, tips in tips_dict.items() %}
## {{ section }} Tips
{{ tips }}
{% endfor %}

Here is the context of the entire paper:
{{ note }}

**Instructions**:
- Use ONLY the information provided in the context above. 
    - DO NOT add any assumptions, invented data, or details that are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

- Ensure that ALL relevant details from the context are included.
    - You are free to organize and structure the content in a natural and logical way, rather than directly following the order or format of the context.
    - You must include all relevant details of methods, experiments, and results—including mathematical equations, pseudocode (if applicable), experimental setups, configurations, numerical results, and figures/tables.
    - When beneficial for clarity, describe the mathematical equations, parameter settings, and procedures in a structured and easy-to-follow way, using natural language or numbered steps.
    - Avoid overly explanatory or repetitive descriptions that would be self-evident to readers familiar with standard machine learning notation.
    - Keep the experimental results (figures and tables) only in the `Results section`, and make sure that any captions are filled in. 
    - If image filenames (e.g., `figure1.pdf`) are provided in the context, refer to them explicitly in the text.

- Avoid editor instructions, placeholders, speculative text, or comments like "details are missing."
    - Example: Remove phrases like "Here’s a refined version of this section," as they are not part of the final document.
    - These phrases are found at the beginning of sections, introducing edits or refinements. Carefully review the start of each section for such instructions and ensure they are eliminated while preserving the actual content.

- The full paper should be **about 8 pages long**, meaning **each section should contain substantial content**.

**Output Format Example** (as JSON):
```json

  "Title": "Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models via Low-Rank Optimization",
